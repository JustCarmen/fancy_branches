Fancy Branches
====================

Fancy Branches Module for webtrees.

This module requires [webtrees 1.6.0](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees).

Description
-----------
This small module is an enhancement of the webtrees Branches list which can be found in the Main Menu  under Lists / Branches. If this module is activated  it allows the user to expand or collapse each family branch to make viewing easier.

It also has an optional styling feature that can display numbering for each family member using the dâ€™Aboville numbering system.Activate the option from the Fancy Branches configuration page in the admin area.

NOTE: It is not not recommended to use this add-on if you have large numbers (thousands) of individuals in a single branch of your family tree. In such cases activating the module could make page load very slow.
